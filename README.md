mediawiki.UncategorizedLonelyPages
==================================

New special page displaying orphaned pages that don't have a category either

I merged UncategorizedPagesPage and LonelyPagesPage together to create this new special page that only displays orphaned pages that don't have a category either.
Usefull for wiki's where categories are used as primary navigation.

Created and working on MediaWiki 1.15.3
